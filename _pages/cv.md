Research Experience
======

* __Asymmetric Cloning to Eavesdrop on BB84 Protocol:__ 			      
	* **_QuForce Innovation Fellow,_** (Mentor Alex Khan, April - August 2022)
		* 1st Place Demo 
		* Worked with another mathematician and a physicist to determine the theoretical optimal strategy for asymmetric cloning on a quantum channel (minimizing disturbance while maximizing information gain). 
		* Compared theoretical expectation to the experimental results from implementation of asymmetric phase-covariant cloning on IonQ’s 11-qubit quantum computer (utilizing the Qiskit SDK).
	* **_Independent Researcher, Continuing QuForce Project_** (August - Present 2022)
		* Expanding our experimental investigation into the trade-off between information gain and detection when eavesdropping on quantum key distribution.
		* Exploring the impact of noise on our base fidelity rates through implementation on IonQ using Native Gates directly.


* __Ph.D. Thesis Project: Lattice Points Close to the Heisenberg Norm,__ OSU (September 2017 - May 2022)
	* Worked with my advisor, Dr. Krystal Taylor, to answer questions at the intersection of harmonic analysis, number theory, and geometric measure theory.
	* Adapted technique used by Iosevich and Taylor (2011) to count lattice points on and near smooth surfaces to instead count lattice points on and near surfaces with vanishing curvature.
	* Removed the non-vanishing Gaussian curvature condition for similarly homogeneous objects defined by norms. The limitation lies in the decay of the Fourier transform of the surface measure.
	* Leveraged the geometry of Heisenberg norm balls to attain results despite vanishing curvature. This work is generalizable to similar objects (those with less homogenous dilations along one axis).
	* Utilized method to estimate the number of lattice points in and near the intersection of two surfaces (described by the same or different norms).


* __Intern, Continuing Fall Project: Topological Data Analysis Applied to Football,__ Mined XAI (December 2021 - January 2022) 	
	* Analyzed remaining play-types: engineered predictive features for punts to cluster into different strategies with UMAP and HDBSCAN. Clustered on the 1-skeleton of alpha complexes for initial kickoff positions.
	* We expanded the SciPy Voronoi class to include points at infinity and compute Voronoi distance, then further extended this to an alpha complex class which constructs the 1-skeleton of an alpha complex.


* __The Erdős Institute Boot Camp:__
	* **_Topological Data Analysis Applied to Football_** (September - December 2021)
		* A Fall 2021 Top Project
		* Collaborated with two mathematicians and a research scientist on the NFL Big Data Bowl 2022 Kaggle Challenge.
		* Engineered predictive features by play-type to cluster into different strategies with UMAP and HDBSCAN.
		* Applied predictive modeling to each cluster to create a new metric for special teams play. 

	* **_Predicting COVID Spread_** (September - December 2020)
		* Partnered with physics Ph.D. student to study COVID-19 spread at the county level in the United States as of December 2020 utilizing Random Forest and Nearest Neighbors Predictors (implemented in Python).
		* Compared responses to the pandemic across states by considering factors such as mask use, poverty levels, median age of the population, and population density in each county.


* __Graduate Researcher at Autonomy Technology Research Center,__ Wright State University (May - August 2018)
	* Collaborated with Dr. Trevor Bihl from Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) on an applied math problem in Detecting and Analyzing Anomalies with Topological Data Analysis.
	* Improved community understanding of how topological data analysis (TDA) could be used for detecting and analyzing anomalies in large data sets—specifically those describing visual data.
	* Compared the efficacy of analyzing the MNIST dataset through TDA to an analysis with diffusion maps by running topological models through the Ayasdi platform and applying diffusion maps in MATLAB.


* __Elm Encryption/Decryption Program,__  (January - May 2018)
	* Using the Elm programming language, developed a program to encrypt and decrypt messages in the ADFGVX cipher used by the Germans in World War I.
	* Extended this program to implement the alterations to the cipher I developed in my undergraduate thesis.
	* Inspired to use Elm and guided in learning to implement Elm code by Dr. Jim Carlson.
	
	
* __Undergraduate Thesis Project: Linguistics and Mathematics in Cryptology,__ NYU (January - April 2014)
	* Researched the effect on linguistic structures of various crypto-systems and techniques surveyed in previous study, The Evolution of Cryptology (listed below). 
	* Performed a comprehensive analysis--mathematical and linguistic--of both an original field cipher from World War I (the ADFGVX cipher) and my modified version. 
	* Focused on the mathematical representations of the ciphers' attributes and their effects on the linguistic structure of the plaintext message as compared to the patterns and structures evident after encryption.
	* Culminated in a 49-page analytical paper proposing meaningful alterations to the cipher, which were further supported by cryptanalytic techniques attempted against them and distinct differences in the patterns of original and encrypted messages.	
	
	
* See [CV PDF](https://egrace479.github.io/files/Campolongo_CV_Autumn_2022.pdf) for more research and professional experience.
