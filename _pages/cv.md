Selected Projects (pre-2023)
======	

* __Asymmetric Cloning to Eavesdrop on BB84 Protocol:__ 			      
	* **_QuForce Innovation Fellow,_** (Mentor Alex Khan, April - August 2022)
		* 1st Place Demo 
		* Worked with another mathematician and a physicist to determine the theoretical optimal strategy for asymmetric cloning on a quantum channel (minimizing disturbance while maximizing information gain). 
		* Compared theoretical expectation to the experimental results from implementation of asymmetric phase-covariant cloning on IonQ’s 11-qubit quantum computer (utilizing the Qiskit SDK).
	* **_Independent Researcher, Continuing QuForce Project_** (August 2022 - March 2023)
		* Expanding our experimental investigation into the trade-off between information gain and detection when eavesdropping on quantum key distribution.
		* Exploring the impact of noise on our base fidelity rates through implementation on IonQ using Native Gates directly.


* __Ph.D. Thesis Project: Lattice Points Close to the Heisenberg Norm__, _Advisor Prof. K. Taylor_, OSU (September 2017 - May 2022)
	* Adapted technique used by Iosevich and Taylor (2011) to count lattice points on and near smooth surfaces to instead count lattice points on and near surfaces with vanishing curvature.
		* Removed the non-vanishing Gaussian curvature condition for similarly homogeneous objects defined by norms. The limitation lies in the decay of the Fourier transform of the surface measure.
		* Leveraged the geometry of Heisenberg norm balls to attain results despite vanishing curvature. This work is generalizable to similar objects (those with less homogenous dilations along one axis).
	* Utilized method to estimate the number of lattice points in and near the intersection of two surfaces.


* __The Erdős Institute Boot Camp:__
	* **_Topological Data Analysis Applied to Football_** (September - December 2021)
		* A Fall 2021 Top Project
		* Collaborated with two mathematicians and a research scientist on the NFL Big Data Bowl 2022 Kaggle Challenge.
		* Engineered predictive features by play-type to cluster into different strategies with UMAP and HDBSCAN.
		* Applied predictive modeling to each cluster to create a new metric for special teams play. 

	* **_Predicting COVID Spread_** (September - December 2020)
		* Partnered with physics Ph.D. student to study COVID-19 spread at the county level in the United States as of December 2020 utilizing Random Forest and Nearest Neighbors Predictors (implemented in Python).
		* Compared responses to the pandemic across states by considering factors such as mask use, poverty levels, median age of the population, and population density in each county.
