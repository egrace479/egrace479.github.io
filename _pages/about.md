I am the Senior Data Scientist for the [Imageomics Institute](https://imageomics.org/) (an NSF Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) institute) and the [AI & Biodiversity Change (ABC) Global Center](http://abcresearchcenter.org/) (a joint NSF and NSERC global center). 
At Imageomics, I work on data-driven biological trait discovery and understanding through the use of machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) applied to images (the field of _imageomics_). At ABC, we explore the broader scale of biodiversity and ecological change, such as species ranges, and the impact of environmental change. Much of my work is centered on ensuring our research is FAIR and reproducible. Some of my favorite projects are listed under [Research](https://egrace479.github.io/research/).

I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics at The Ohio State University in Summer 2022. My mathematical interests are diverse, though my dissertation research focused on harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and number theory. I have also done some work in topological data analysis (TDA) during an internship at the Autonomous Technology Research Center at Wright State University in partnership with the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL).

Always looking for opportunities to apply my skills in new ways, I have participated in various [Erdős Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) programs. Building off my interest in cryptology, I designed an encryption and decryption program using Elm after participating in an Elm workshop at the Erdős Institute. As part of the Erdős Institute Fall Boot Camp, I partnered with an OSU physics Ph.D. student to study COVID-19 spread at the county level in the United States as of December 2020 utilizing Random Forest and Nearest Neighbors Predictors. In 2021, I collaborated with two other mathematicians and a data scientist on the NFL Big Data Bowl Challenge ([Phase 1](https://github.com/egrace479/NFL-BDB-2022) & [Phase 2](https://github.com/egrace479/NFL_TDA)). We engineered predictive features by play-type to cluster into different strategies and applied predictive modeling to the clusters to create a new metric for special teams play. 
The following year, I was selected as a 2022 [QuForce](https://quforce.org/) Innovation Fellow. For that program, I teamed up with a fellow mathematician and physics Ph.D. candidate to work on a quantum computing project ([Asymmetric Cloning to Eavesdrop on BB84 Protocol](https://github.com/egrace479/QuForceBB84Proj)).
We implemented asymmetric cloning to eavesdrop on the BB84 Protocol, comparing the theoretical expectation to the experimental results from implementation on IonQ’s 11-qubit quantum computer. Our demo recieved first place, and after the program we expanded our experimental investigation to explore the impact of noise on our base fidelity rates through implementation on IonQ using Native Gates directly ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16284) & [associated code](https://github.com/egrace479/asymmetric-cloning-BB84)).


Before I came to OSU, I earned my B.A. in “The Language of Mathematics” at New York University Gallatin School of Individualized Study. For my Senior Thesis Project “Linguistics and Mathematics in Cryptology,” I performed a mathematical and linguistic analysis of both an original field cipher from World War I (the ADFGVX cipher) and my modified version.

I spent my final year at OSU as President of the OSU Chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM). My focus was on the transition of our group into a hybrid mode with greater resources available online to increase accessibility and membership.
